My name is Frank Johnson, and I'm a designer of objects, applications, and organizations. _Frank RJ Noirot_ is only my pseudonym, [at least for now](/im-changing-my-name).

I use this website as two things:
  1. A To-Do list to keep me documenting and working.
  2. A portfolio for you!

### Wide Net / Deep Dive
My whole life I have struggled to find a specialty or expertise- sort of a jack of all trades, master of none situation. I blame it on all the cool stuff there is to learn in the world. But I'm looking to change that now by entering a graduate program this year, so I can dive deep into an area of inquiry and start helping on [wicked problems](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). These kinds of problems are deadly serious, and need _jacks of all trades, masters of some_ to surmount together.

The upshot of my wide net is that it has lowered my [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) as a designer. I feel confident that I can be useful in almost any studio/lab for three reasons:
  1. I love working on nearly anything.
  2. I have a working knowledge on subjects from machine design to watercolor to geospatial data.
  3. These two prior facts combine into the _**lifestyle of inquiry**_ that is my happy habit.

- Nature is smarter than you.
- Privilege is a debt to be repaid.
- Opensource is not optional.
- If you don't document it, it doesn't exist.

I built this using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a slightly modified version of the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). It's hosted using the graciously free [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) platform.
