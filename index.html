    <h3>Iridium Satellite</h3>
    <p>Iridium has given me the chance to make a lot of wildly different things. I've made a rocket launch patch. I've helped organize a metadata system for 300+ products, 1700+ documents, and 1000+ users. I've taken product photography. I've helped manage three Wordpress sites.</p>
    <p>This is where I've learned how much I love building things, especially tools, for other people.</p>
