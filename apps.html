  <p>I have focused for the last two years on learning web development and design. I have made mostly small toy apps, and in addition I have managed one enterprise web system and made two complete websites.</p>
  <p>The following projects are listed in order of descending amount of <span class="fun" style="--delay: 0s">f</span><span class="fun" style="--delay: 0.1s">u</span><span class="fun" style="--delay: 0.2s">n</span> they were to work on.</span></p>

  <h2 class="app__title">Audio Player Mini App</h2>
  <a class="app__visit" href="/player">Visit App</a>
  <p class="app__tools">Svelte.js</p>
  <p class="app__date">August 2019</p>
  <p>I created this small single page app as my second test project using <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Svelte.js</a>, a fantastic library for creating ridiculously lightweight websites. It's based on a <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6862618-Minimalistic-Player-Widget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dribbble Shot by The Glyph</a>.</p>
  <p>Switch between tracks in the playlist by clicking, or add a new track you find on the web by clicking Add Track. Keyboard-friendly! Try WASD to emulate the mousemove parallax effect.</p>

    <a class="app__visit" href="https://iridium.com" rel="noopener">Visit Site</a>
    <p class="app__tools">Wordpress</p>
    <p class="app__date">August 2017 &ndash August 2019</p>
    <p>I didn't have the pleasure of building the web ecosystem for Iridium Satellites, but I helped migrate it to WordPress as a member of the Iridium Marketing Team.</p>
    <p>I organized the document repository housed in the Iridium For Partners portion of the site, and managed the platform day-to-day with content updates and user support.</p>

    <p class="app__tools">Jekyll, GitHub Pages</p>
    <p class="app__date">November 2018 &ndash; Present</p>
    <p>My personal website was my first foray into web design and development, and has served as my playground for experimentation ever since. God bless GitHub for their free static site hosting.</p>

    <h2 class="app__title">Pantone Color Picker</h2>
    <a class="app__visit" href="/picker">Visit App</a>
    <p class="app__tools">Svelte.js</p>
    <p class="app__date">July 2019</p>
    <p>My first test project using Svelte.js. I relied on the excellent <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Margaret2/pantone-colors/master/pantone-colors.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dataset by Margaret2</a> on GitHub for the Pantone color names and RGB values.</p>
    <p>Click around and change any values to see all the rest update, click the Pantone values to copy, and click the color name to Google search for it.</p>

    <h2 class="app__title">AsheArtists.co</h2>
    <a class="app__visit" href="https://asheartists.co">Visit Site</a>
    <p class="app__tools">Squarespace</p>
    <p class="app__date">March 2019</p>
    <p>Ash√© Artists is a project by two of my college friends, which will be a digital networking resource for freelance dancers. I'm no dancer, but they brought me on as an art and business adviser.</p>
    <p>Squarespace provided what we needed to get started, but I've found customizing it really cumbersome, and will likely rebuilt this with Gatsby and Sanity when we return to work on the project.</p>
