I can't stop thinking about the mathematical UX work done by [Brett Victor](http://worrydream.com/#!/KillMath), and the even more in-depth response by [Michael Nielsen](http://mnielsen.github.io/notes/kill_math/kill_math.html). I'm particularly stuck on this bit from Nielsen under the section "Moving Theorems Into the User Interface":
> That is we should move theorems into the user interface. Tipping it upside down, we can view theorems as challenges to develop a user interface which reifies those theorems in a powerful way, providing the user with cues that help them reason, and representing mathematical objects in ways that help suggest the relevant operations and relationships.

I'm really excited by this because I think I stumbled upon it while making my [Thales Theorem](/code/understanding-geometry-with-d3-js) tool. I built it to make a static geometry theorem more interactive and embodied, so that I could really understand it in my native mindset. Here's a bit more from Nielsen:

> I found it helpful to begin my experiments by picking a piece of simple but genuine mathematics where it's possible to give a plausible account of discovery.

That what I was so struck by when using my little Thales tool when I finished it. Just messing around with this little toy geometry system made me feel so much more in-tune with how circles and triangles inter-relate. It's little world to explore and discover in.
