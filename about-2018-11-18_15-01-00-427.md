# About

My name is Frank R Johnson, and I love to make art and tools. Frank RJ Noirot is only my pseudonym, at [least for now](https://franknoirot.co/write/im-changing-my-name).

#### Work
I work at [Iridium Satellite](http://iridium.com) as a Marketing Associate, which means I do everything from taking all the product photography to help managing their websites. I'm most proud of the reorganization I did of their system of metadata for all of their hosted files, products, and partner companies, although the coolest thing I've worked on is probably the commemorative patch for their final rocket launch.

##### Ongoing List of Design Principles
- Waste is an outdated concept. Design the thing, then design the system.
- Nature is smarter than you. Learn from her.
- Privilege is a debt to be repaid.
- Opensource is not optional.
- If you don't document it, it doesn't exist.

#### Education
I went to Ohio State University and studied City & Regional Planning at [the Knowlton School](https://knowlton.osu.edu/), graduating in 2017. While I was there I helped found [OSU Maker Club](http://osumakerclub.org/), an organization that gives students of any major access to the amazing tool shops and technology that Ohio State has to offer, and holds weekly meetings to teach one another how to design and make things. The 3D printer and [CNC machine](https://www.v1engineering.com/specifications/) that I donated to them have been used by hundreds of students, and the club is going on its fifth year now.

Over the next two years, I am working to enter graduate school to study design and engineering, with preference toward the [MIT Media Lab](media.mit.edu). I have cast a wide net in my studies, and now I hope to take a deep dive and become an expert at something, so I can start being useful to solve wicked problems. One aim of this website is to help me pick where to dive.

#### Life
These days I'm focusing on learning to code, work with data, build furniture, and basically how to live with complete curiousity. I live in DC, but I commute to NYC most weekends to see my wonderful partner, Emily. Right now I love the music of Milo, Saintseneca, and Moses Sumney.

If you'd like to work with me or discuss ideas, [I'm always available via email](mailto:frank@franknoirot.co), or check out my [Instagram]({{ site.instagram }}), or [Github]({{ site.github }}) to learn more.
