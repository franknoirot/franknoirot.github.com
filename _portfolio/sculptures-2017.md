I made two sculptures over the summer and winter of 2017.

### Middle Passage
_polymer clay, wire, wood, paint_

I learned about the myth of the scorpion and the frog around the same time that I was reading Ta Nehisi Coate's _Between the World and Me_. This is the result of those crossed wires in the head of a white boy.

### Hand, Shooting
_papier mache clay, wire_

This work is simply form, no purposeful thematic statement. I wanted to try out papier mache clay using newspaper collected from work, and I had been intrigued by how that might look having a scale human body part coming our of a wall of the same color. I like the effect.
