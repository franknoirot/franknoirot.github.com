I built this cajon, or box drum, in the spring of 2018 for my girlfriend Emily.

I followed the simple steps that many other have documented on how to build a box drum, including how to make it with an adjustable snare. The one addition I made is to design the gear handle for the snare adjustment.

This project was a rewarding combination of only a few simple steps. It was a big confidence boost for me as a DIYer.
