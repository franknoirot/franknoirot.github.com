<p>My name is Frank Johnson, and I’m a designer of objects, applications, and organizations. <em>Frank RJ Noirot</em> is my pseudonym.</p>

<p>I use this website as two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A To-Do list to keep me documenting and working.</li>
  <li>A portfolio for you!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wide-net--deep-dive">Wide Net / Deep Dive</h3>
<p>I have decided I am too scattered in my interests, and I lack <em>depth</em> in my work. I’m looking to change that by entering a graduate program this year, so I can dive deep into an area of inquiry and start helping on <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">wicked problems</a>.</p>

<p>The upshot of my wide net is that it has lowered my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> as a designer. I feel confident that I can be useful in almost any studio/lab for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I love working on nearly anything.</li>
  <li>I have a working knowledge on subjects from machine design to watercolor to geospatial data.</li>
  <li>These two prior facts combine into the <em><strong>lifestyle of inquiry</strong></em> that is my happy habit.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to get in touch, reach out through any of my contact info on the footer of this site!</p>

<h3 id="principles-design--otherwise">Principles, Design &amp; Otherwise</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Waste is a design flaw.</li>
  <li>Nature is smarter than you.</li>
  <li>Privilege is a debt to be repaid.</li>
  <li>Opensource is not optional.</li>
  <li>If you don’t document it, it doesn’t exist.</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>I built this using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> with a slightly modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">minima theme</a>. It’s hosted using the graciously free <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> platform.</p>
