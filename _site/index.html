        <h3>Iridium Satellite</h3>
        <p class="role">Marketing Associate  |  August 2017 &ndash; Present</p>
        <p>
          Iridium has given me the chance to work on every facet of marketing, and make a lot of wildly different things. I've designed a rocket launch patch. 
          I've helped organize a content management system with 300+ products, 1700+ documents, and 1000+ users. I've taken product 
          photography, and I've helped manage three Wordpress sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          This team has supported all the growth of my young career and given me the chance to 
          build my confidence as a professional.

        <p>
          Ashé is a new organization dedicated to supporting dancers, founded by two fellow OSU alumni. I've helped them
          form the gameplan for the business as well as run a blog and an Instagram account. I make most of the feature art and 
          merchandise designs, and I recently creating a series of ad videos with After Effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've learned a lot as we struggled through a long process of finding our voice and mission. 
          I'm really excited for this next phase where we grow the community.

        <p>I've been making furniture occasionally over the last three years. It's been a really rewarding creative outlet,

          friends and family.

        <h3>Family Christmas Posters</h3>
        <p class="role">Gifts for Nieces &amp; Nephews | December 2018</p>
        <p>I made these posters for my nieces and nephews because though I don't get to see my nieces and 
          nephews as much as I would like, I wanted them to know how much I think about and love them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to capture some element of their personality that they might not recognize in themselves and give it an
          image, with the hope that they could maybe see it someday and be proud of themselves. I made them all with Adobe
          Illustrator and printed them on 11 x 17 poster prints.
