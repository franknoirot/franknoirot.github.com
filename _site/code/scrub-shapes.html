<p>I can’t stop thinking about the mathematical UX work done by <a href="worrydream.com/#!/KillMath">Brett Victor</a>, and the even more in-depth response by <a href="http://mnielsen.github.io/notes/kill_math/kill_math.html">Michael Nielsen</a>. I’m particularly stuck on this bit from Nielsen under the section “Moving Theorems Into the User Interface”:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That is we should move theorems into the user interface. Tipping it upside down, we can view theorems as challenges to develop a user interface which reifies those theorems in a powerful way, providing the user with cues that help them reason, and representing mathematical objects in ways that help suggest the relevant operations and relationships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been surprised on how few people seemed to build directly on their work from 2012, especially in ways that are opensource and toolbox-ready. I want to explore some of the atomic UX problems Nielsen poses in his notes in the coming months, particularly creating a gesture for instantly graphing an equation, built to work with <a href="mathjax.org">MathJax</a>.</p>

<p>But I see a branch of this problem that could help me more directly in my furniture and product design work. What if I could present a model of a furniture piece in the browser, and allow a user to <strong>customize certain dimensions live by scrubbing its annotations?</strong> When they’re happy with the dimensions they’ve found, they would then be able to submit it to me as a commission request with a simple button press.</p>

<p>Eventually I will make this into a tool for <a href="threejs.org">THREE.js</a>, where I can embed “scrubbable” triggers into whichever dimensions I want, and the user will be able to tweak while viewing in 3D. But we can build to that from a 2D. So let’s start with the simplest geometry: a line.</p>

<p>To scrub the width of the line, simply click and drag on the variable name!</p>

<p><em>insert scrubbable line</em></p>

<p>You can tweak <code class="highlighter-rouge">length</code> in smaller increments by holding Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) before clicking and dragging. This is bit newer on mobile, what I call “pin &amp; drag”. Pin the variable by holding a finger on one variable, then drag with another to tweak.</p>

<p>Next, let’s control a rectangle with two scrubbers.</p>

<p><em>insert scrubbable rectangle</em></p>

<p>Because this is built up in a modular way, we can now tweak <strong>an arbitrary number of variables on a 2D graphic!</strong></p>

<p>// insert front of desk outline with scrubbable variables</p>

<p>This UI has a bit more going on behind the scenes. Before the annotation renders, it first determines how much space it has to unfold. if there’s no room for a full brace and variable name, it collapses to a small pin with <code class="highlighter-rouge">fx</code> inside to show this dimension is scrubbable. Let me know if it’s intuitive to use!</p>

<p>One more piece makes this a viable first step for my custom furniture tool. Three tabs labelled <em>Top, Front, &amp; Side</em> allow me to get at least a good proxy representation of the 3D piece, and the variable scrubbing affects dimensions between the different panes.</p>

<p><em>insert three pane furniture scrubber</em></p>
