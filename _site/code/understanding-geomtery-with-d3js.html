<p>In my internet wanderings I came across a Wiki page on a geometry principle known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27s_theorem">Thales’s Theorem</a>. It caught my eye because its creator inspired the name of one of the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">biggest partners</a> of my employer, <a href="https://iridium.com">Iridium Satellite</a>.</p>

<p>This little toy application was made using only CSS and <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> Drag the three points around the circle to get used to how the system works!</p>

<p>Before we get to Thales, lets describe the general version of his theorem, which is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_angle_theorem">Inscribed Angle Theorem</a>. It’s definition is super wonky, but its <em>implication</em> is that for any triangle inscribed into a circle, sweeping one angle along the circle while keeping the other two points fixed, <strong>the sweeping angle will always stay the same!</strong></p>

<p>Isn’t that kind of wild? Maybe its because my school skipped Geometry for my year (true story), but this blew my mind in the small way things do when you glimpse a deep true mathematical relationship.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve got the general case of the sweeping angle down, I want you to pull a Thales and position one side of the triangle so that it runs straight through the dot in the center of the circle. <strong>The angle across from that line will always be exactly 90°!</strong> Whew, people are so smart. But there’s more to explore here.</p>

<p>Notice, for example that the angle you sweep along the circle <em>always stays the same, not just for the 90° case mentioned above</em>. This is called the , which is the more generalized case of the one posed by Thales.</p>

<p>Or notice how in essence, the sweeping angle is in some ways <em>a simple proportion of the circle that is bisected by the line across it</em>. The more of the circle chopped across by a side of the triangle, the bigger the angle across from it, approaching but never reaching 180°. This sideles into the fundamental nature of how cosine and sine relate triangles to circles, and for the first time I felt those concepts in a visceral way.</p>

<p>This was a blast of a little project to work on. Not only did I start to learn about optimizing code, and abstraction principles, but I am understanding what gets <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Bret Victor</a> <a href="https://dynamicland.org/">so excited</a> about what he calls <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable">“The Dynamic Medium”</a>. Now when I fall down the Wiki rabbit hole, I’m looking for new systems that I can better understand through interactivity. <a href="mailto:frank@franknoirot.co">Let me know</a> if you’ve found anything you want to model!</p>
