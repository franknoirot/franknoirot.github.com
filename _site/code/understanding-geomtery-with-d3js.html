<p>In my internet wanderings I came across a Wiki page on a geometry principle known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27s_theorem">Thales’s Theorem</a>. It caught my eye because its creator inspired the name of one of the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">biggest partners</a> of my employer, <a href="https://iridium.com">Iridium Satellite</a>.</p>

<p>It starts with a triangle inscribed inside a circle, meaning its three points lie along the circle. If one of those sides goes through the center point of the circle, the angle opposite that side will <strong>always be a 90°!</strong> No matter where that last point is, all along the circle, that angle will always be the same.</p>

<p>This is such a such a simple, and to many, straightforward fact of geometry, but I can’t stop thinking about how cool it is! The little animation on Wikipedia broke my brain in that small joyful way that any moment of learning does, and knew I wanted to make a tool to really feel how the principles of Thales’s Theorem worked.</p>

<p>I built this little tool using only CSS and D3.js. Drag around the points on the circle and you can physically start to sense just how the mechanics of this system works.</p>

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="BqxzRv" data-default-tab="result" data-user="franknoirot" data-pen-title="Thales Theorem" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/franknoirot/pen/BqxzRv/">Thales Theorem</a> by Frank Noirot (<a href="https://codepen.io/franknoirot">@franknoirot</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async="" src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>The first thing you should do is pull a Thales and position one line so that it runs straight through the dot in the center of the circle. The angle across from that line is exactly 90°! Whew, people are so smart. But there’s more to explore here.</p>

<p>Notice, for example that the angle you sweep along the circle <em>always stays the same, not just for the 90° case mentioned above</em>. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_angle_theorem">Inscribed Angle Theorem</a>, which is the more generalized case of the one posed by Thales.</p>

<p>Or notice how in essence, the sweeping angle is in some ways <em>a simple proportion of the circle that is bisected by the line across it</em>. The more of the circle chopped across by a side of the triangle, the bigger the angle across from it, approaching but never reaching 180°. This sideles into the fundamental nature of how cosine and sine relate triangles to circles, and for the first time I felt those concepts in a visceral way.</p>

<p>This was a blast of a little project to work on. Not only did I start to learn about optimizing code, and abstraction principles, but I am understanding what gets <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Bret Victor</a> <a href="https://dynamicland.org/">so excited</a> about what he calls <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable">“The Dynamic Medium”</a>. Now when I fall down the Wiki rabbit hole, I’m looking for new systems that I can better understand through interactivity. <a href="mailto:frank@franknoirot.co">Let me know</a> if you’ve found anything you want to model!</p>
