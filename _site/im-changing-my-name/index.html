<p>On December 1st, 2018 I will be starting the process of changing my legal name from <em>Frank Richard Johnson</em> to <em>Francis Richard Johnson Noirot</em>. I have been using my mother’s maiden name in various pseudonymous ways, but I’m finally making it official. I consider it my first major act of designing myself and my life. Here are the few reasons that I’m making the jump:</p>
<h2 id="1-having-a-formalized-version-of-a-first-name-is-the-best">1. Having a formalized version of a first name is the best</h2>
<p>I’m staking a lifelong position here: every person ought to have a name with both formal and casual versions. Quote me on it. My frustration with an official name like Frank has mounted with every missed understanding, every time my name magically became a bark or “Brent” in the space between my mouth and my audience’s ears. I’m sure all my fellow 1-syllable-namers can concur: the 2-syllable name is a godsend for introductions.</p>
<h2 id="2-nor--ō">2. /<em>nor · ‘ō</em>/</h2>
<p>My maternal family name is just so cool to say in the French manner. Truthfully, my entire family pronouces it  in the Americanized /’nor · ot/). But my uncle Kevin and I like to have more fun with it.</p>
<h2 id="3-family-history">3. Family history</h2>
<p>I will write about this much at much more length later in life, but my life growing up was shaped by being placed at the center of two families reckoning with longstanding secrets and abuses. Both have had members cracked under the toxic pressures of constructed male legacy and <em>family curses</em>, my paternal side much worse. I once had my father sit me down and say that as the only male in the lineage, I was destined to succumb to the sins of him, his father, and his grandfather, Francis Richard Johnson. Tearfully, he told me that abusers beget abused, who become abusers in their own time.</p>

<p>This moment, 5 years ago, set me on this path to name change. I don’t need to go line by line about how wrong-headed my father’s picture of life was in that moment of worry, but I do have two points. First, it discounts the miraculous strength and wisdom that are the real legacies of the Johnson and Noirot family tree: Dessie Johnson, Lois Noirot, Melodi Pilz, Dani Johnson (I’ll link to the essay I want to write about this in the future). Second, it shows just how much my father sees himself as an Ethan Frome, a tragic hero locked in the small confines of a someone else’s story.</p>

<p>With this name change, I will make formal my rejection of that cycle of family tragedy. I will reject that birthright and that story, and turn toward the mother and grandmother who made me the man I am today. And I move on hoping to make them proud carrying their story forward.</p>

<p>I also get to have the same <a href="https://www.instagram.com/franknoirot">instagram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/franknoirot">github</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/franknoirot">twitter</a> handles, so that’s pretty nice too.</p>
