It caught my eye because its creator inspired the name of one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thalesgroup.com/en&quot;&gt;biggest partners&lt;/a&gt; of my employer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iridium.com&quot;&gt;Iridium Satellite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with a triangle inscribed inside a circle, meaning its three points lie along the circle. If one of those sides goes through the center point of the circle, the angle opposite that side will &lt;strong&gt;always be a 90°!&lt;/strong&gt; No matter where that last point is, all along the circle, that angle will always be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is such a such a simple, and to many, straightforward fact of geometry, but I can’t stop thinking about how cool it is! The little animation on Wikipedia broke my brain in that small joyful way that any moment of learning does, and knew I wanted to make a tool to really feel how the principles of Thales’s Theorem worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built this little tool using only CSS and D3.js. Drag around the points on the circle and you can physically start to sense just how the mechanics of this system works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height=&quot;600&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;BqxzRv&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result,js&quot; data-user=&quot;franknoirot&quot; data-pen-title=&quot;Thales Theorem&quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/franknoirot/pen/BqxzRv/&quot;&gt;Thales Theorem&lt;/a&gt; by Frank Noirot (&lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/franknoirot&quot;&gt;@franknoirot&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is pull a Thales and position one line so that it runs straight through the dot in the center of the circle. The angle across from that line is exactly 90°! Whew, people are so smart. But there’s more to explore here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice, for example that the angle you sweep along the circle &lt;em&gt;always stays the same, not just for the 90° case mentioned above&lt;/em&gt;. This is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_angle_theorem&quot;&gt;Inscribed Angle Theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which is the more generalized case of the one posed by Thales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or notice how in essence, the sweeping angle is in some ways &lt;em&gt;a simple proportion of the circle that is bisected by the line across it&lt;/em&gt;. The more of the circle chopped across by a side of the triangle, the bigger the angle across from it, approaching but never reaching 180°. This sideles into the fundamental nature of how cosine and sine relate triangles to circles, and for the first time I felt those concepts in a visceral way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a blast of a little project to work on. Not only did I start to learn about optimizing code, and abstraction principles, but I am understanding what gets &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/&quot;&gt;Bret Victor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dynamicland.org/&quot;&gt;so excited&lt;/a&gt; about what he calls &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/#!/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable&quot;&gt;“The Dynamic Medium”&lt;/a&gt;. Now when I fall down the Wiki rabbit hole, I’m looking for new systems that I can better understand through interactivity. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hey@franknoirot.io&quot;&gt;Let me know&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve found anything you want to model!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frank RJ Noirot</name></author><category term="code" /><summary type="html">Recently in my internet wanderings I came across a Wiki page on a geometry principle known as Thales's Theorem.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I’m Changing My Name</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/im-changing-my-name/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I'm Changing My Name" /><published>2018-10-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/im-changing-my-name</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/im-changing-my-name/">&lt;p&gt;On December 1st, 2018 I will be starting the process of changing my legal name from &lt;em&gt;Frank Richard Johnson&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Francis Richard Johnson Noirot&lt;/em&gt;. I have been using my mother’s maiden name in various pseudonymous ways, but I’m finally making it official. I consider it my first major act of designing myself and my life. Here are the few reasons that I’m making the jump:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-having-a-formalized-version-of-a-first-name-is-the-best&quot;&gt;1. Having a formalized version of a first name is the best&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m staking a lifelong position here: every person ought to have a name with both formal and casual versions. Quote me on it. My frustration with an official name like Frank has mounted with every missed understanding, every time my name magically became a bark or “Brent” in the space between my mouth and my audience’s ears. I’m sure all my fellow 1-syllable-namers can concur: the 2-syllable name is a godsend for introductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-nor--ō&quot;&gt;2. /&lt;em&gt;nor · ‘ō&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My maternal family name is just so cool to say in the French manner. Truthfully, my entire family pronouces it  in the Americanized /’nor · ot/). But my uncle Kevin and I like to have more fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-family-history&quot;&gt;3. Family history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will write about this much at much more length later in life, but my life growing up was shaped by being placed at the center of two families reckoning with longstanding secrets and abuses. Both have had members cracked under the toxic pressures of constructed male legacy and &lt;em&gt;family curses&lt;/em&gt;, my paternal side much worse. I once had my father sit me down and say that as the only male in the lineage, I was destined to succumb to the sins of him, his father, and his grandfather, Francis Richard Johnson. Tearfully, he told me that abusers beget abused, who become abusers in their own time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This moment, 5 years ago, set me on this path to name change. I don’t need to go line by line about how wrong-headed my father’s picture of life was in that moment of worry, but I do have two points. First, it discounts the miraculous strength and wisdom that are the real legacies of the Johnson and Noirot family tree: Dessie Johnson, Lois Noirot, Melodi Pilz, Dani Johnson (I’ll link to the essay I want to write about this in the future). Second, it shows just how much my father sees himself as an Ethan Frome, a tragic hero locked in the small confines of a someone else’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this name change, I will make formal my rejection of that cycle of family tragedy. I will reject that birthright and that story, and turn toward the mother and grandmother who made me the man I am today. And I move on hoping to make them proud carrying their story forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also get to have the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/franknoirot&quot;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/franknoirot&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/franknoirot&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; handles, so that’s pretty nice too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frank RJ Noirot</name></author><category term="write" /><summary type="html">On December 1st, 2018 I will be starting the process of changing my legal name from Frank Richard Johnson to Francis Richard Johnson Noirot.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Steel &amp;amp; Plywood Chair</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/steel-chair/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Steel &amp; Plywood Chair" /><published>2018-09-21T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/steel-chair</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/steel-chair/">&lt;p&gt;This simple chair was my first attempt at welding.
