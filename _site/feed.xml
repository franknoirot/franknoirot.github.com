&lt;p&gt;Tap around below to use it, then scroll to read why I made it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color spaces are fascinating to me because they reveal the complexity underlying something so familiar a intuitive to us, color. Most people in the digital age are quite comfortable using tools like the colorpicker in Adobe Creative products, but so often we don’t know that in order to make a tool like that we have to understand and map out all the possible colors in that space. How we design the tool affects the metaphors users employ to understand the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this I tried to make the color space of HSL feel more immediately understandable. Adobe’s colorpicker consists of a square mapping the Saturation in the X direction and Lightness in the Y for a given Hue. A rectangular bar to the right of this square lets the user select the Hue, always showing the rainbow of Hue values at S = 100% and L = 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/d3js-colorpicker/adobe-colorpicker.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adobe's colorpicker, snipped from Adobe Illustrator.&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This arrangement is useful and quick to use, but hides some truths about the HSL color space’s reality. With this layout, you might think that the HSL color space is a cube or prism, just extending the square of Saturation-Lightness vertically along a Hue axis. But this prism is red at both ends: if we want to move from orange to purple we feel like we’re teleporting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/d3js-colorpicker/adobe-colorspace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of the color space model implied by the Adobe Color Picker.&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because the HSL color space is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV&quot;&gt;best represented as a &lt;strong&gt;bicone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially two cones attached at the bottom. Hue is measured in degrees about the circle of the cones, Saturation by the distance from the circle’s center, and Lightness is actually that vertical dimension along the bicone. This space lets us move between any color values without discontinuities, it is &lt;em&gt;compact&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My color picker tries to acknowledge the true shape of the color space we’re exploring, while remaining useful and intuitive. The circle is a cross section of the bicone at the given lightness value, and the radius of the circle shrinks as you move away from Lightness = 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This arrangement makes tangible one concept that isn’t present in the Adobe one: &lt;strong&gt;that the selection of perceivably different colors shrinks as you get lighter or darker from the middle!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making this piece of furniture felt like a natural extension of my work on the &lt;a href=&quot;/make/steel-plywood-chair&quot;&gt;steel chair&lt;/a&gt;. In essence it is very similar, but in details it was much more difficult. The same rectangular frame of steel was just made more difficult with many more joints and smaller square tubing than before. The same simple plywood was used, but this time I had to learn how to make a box instead of cut simple panels. I highly recommend this as a second, more ambitious furniture piece for people just learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles I learned from the steel chair apply here, but to them I’ll add a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your scraps.&lt;/strong&gt; The wood triangle accents are simply cutoffs from the box of the barcart. You get visual harmony for free by reusing cutoffs from your project, because they repeat the same angles/dimensions throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field measurements &amp;gt; model measurements.&lt;/strong&gt; There is always going to be a difference between the theory and the reality when making things, especially at a beginner level. Learn to take good field measurements so you can go with that flow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes&lt;/em&gt; make things disassemble.&lt;/strong&gt; I made this come apart into three pieces, in case any one of them break or wear down in the future (like refinishing rusted steel in a few years). This is a good thing to consider when building things using multiple materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t mocked up the 3D model of this yet, but I will embed it here for you to download soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in commissioning some furniture from me, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:frank@franknoirot.co&quot;&gt;shoot me an email&lt;/a&gt;. I’m still a pretty poor welder, but I’m willing to do cheap projects in exchange for the chance to practice!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frank RJ Noirot</name></author><summary type="html">I built a custom barcart for my good friend Kaz for his birthday.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Sunday Desk</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/make/2018/06/17/sunday-desk.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Sunday Desk" /><published>2018-06-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/make/2018/06/17/sunday-desk</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/make/2018/06/17/sunday-desk.html">&lt;p&gt;I named this desk the Sunday because that was the day I woke up and designed and built it in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the weirdest projects I think I’ve ever worked on because it was so effortless. It was so much fun, and so surreal, to have a fully formed plan in my head about how to make something then just get to making it. I only drew one sketch before cutting wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if I learned any lessons or best practices from this project other than sometimes you should just let it rip and have fun with making things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNC’s use code to move their center around in three dimensions within a frame. The tool holder at its center can hold anything from a pen to a router or even a laser. It was the perfect thing for me to build while I continue to learn both fabrication and coding- a tool exactly at the center of those two spaces!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this essentially a kit build, I include it in my portfolio because it was such a long process of learning and building. The plastic parts on this machine were 3d printed in over 30 hours of prints that I troubleshooted and assembled. Furthermore, I built the 3D printer that made all those parts, so it has been a nesting doll of fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally getting to see this thing move was amazing. I was so excited to see that it worked that I built another one and donated it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://osumakerclub.org/&quot;&gt;The Maker Club at OSU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;papier mache clay, wire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is simply form, no purposeful thematic statement. I wanted to try out papier mache clay using newspaper collected from work, and I had been intrigued by how that might look having a scale human body part coming our of a wall of the same color. I like the effect.

&lt;p&gt;The first is a &lt;strong&gt;steel &amp;amp; plywood chair&lt;/strong&gt; I made to learn welding from my stepfather after finding out he owned a mig welder. I 3D modeled it after making it for practice, and the model can be seen at the end of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is a replica of a &lt;strong&gt;director’s chair&lt;/strong&gt; I had borrowed from a roommate and had to give back soon. I took it as a good chance to learn some woodworking and sewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some key things I learned while making these were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Welding is a whole lot more forgiving than woodworking, because it contains both &lt;em&gt;additive &amp;amp; subtractive&lt;/em&gt; manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting square is the most important thing about furniture. If you’re off at the start, your errors will compound endlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documenting your exact end product is beneficial for really obvious reasons: so you’re not making design decisions with an electrical torch in your hands and a visor on your head that makes you blind. Not that that happened to me or anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a field-measured 3D CAD model in Autodesk Fusion after I was done building it, and I’ve published it on Sketchfab.com if you’d like to download the model for your own use. Here’s an embedded view:&lt;/p&gt;

I investigated how environmental assets like greenspace and tree canopy coverage correlated with existing data on spatial inequality in Columbus put together by The Kirwan Institute, called the Opportunity Index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work evolved from the naive question “why do wealthier neighborhoods seem to have more greenery everywhere?” It turned out that the more interesting question is validating whether there is a real relationship between wealth and greenspace in Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I found a lot of literature on environmental justice and evnironmental assessment metrics, by accident of history both areas focused almost exclusively on where environmental stressors like polltion exist in relation to wealth and race. Even the Opportunity Index only concerned itself with stressors, not environmental &lt;em&gt;assets&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My adviser Dr. Jason Reece helped develop the Opportunity Index, so he helped me learn how such complex metrics are created and validated. My Research Methods professor and Department Chair Dr. Rachel Garshick Kleit wrap my head around secondary data analysis and analytical writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thesis is presented in full below, but the final presentation slideshow is a good TLDR; version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research explores secondary data of Franklin County, OH to search for a measurable relationship between socioeconomic vitality and the environment. As shown in the Literature Review, it does this to fortify the theoretical bond between environmental and socioeconomic urban mechanics, and integrate urban assessment methods with the agenda of environmental justice. The Methods section lays out all of the secondary data indicators used in this analysis, as well the methods themselves and the motivations behind them. Data Analysis is the heart of the results, in which we demonstrate the meaningful relationship we found between socioeconomic and environmental indicators, inequity in the geographic distributions of each, and stipulations on our results. In our Case Study of the Bexley and Near East neighborhoods, we explore possible policy impacts that may have created such inequitable conditions. In our Discussion, we hypothesize on contributing factors beyond the scope of our results, propose a hypothetical role of discrimination within them, and set forth current limitations of remote urban assessment broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;literature-review&quot;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-development-conflict&quot;&gt;The Development Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This may be the most challenging conundrum of sustainable development: how to increase social equity and protect the environment simultaneously…”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research is largely in response to the writing of Scott Campbell on the three biggest internal conflicts within planning theory’s aims of sustainability&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn6:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We agree that his Development Conflict is one of the most confounding contradictions in the goals of planning theory and practice, but we believe there may be a way to work through it by exploring how the valuation of people and the environment are deeply intertwined. If there is a bridge across this conflict, it lies at the intersection of people and place. More specifically, we believe it lies in addressing the inequity with which we treat both the socioeconomic and environmental urban landscapes. In order to establish a model of measurement at that intersection, we will overview the development of urban assessment from either side of that interdisciplinary divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;socioeconomic-assessment&quot;&gt;Socioeconomic Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways the study of economics has assessment built into it, and thus the instruments of economic assessment date back very far. In general, these assessments are used to monitor the economic health and development of a social body, whether a nation or a neighborhood (Ricardo, 1817). The historical trend in assessment methods has worked from the prior to the latter, decreasing in scale as collection methods and technologies became more advanced (Schumpeter, 1954). In parallel with the disaggregation of assessment methods, these methods have developed with some tools into increasingly complex and holistic tools of urban analysis (Chapple, 2015). This was the addition of “socio-” to the term “economic analysis,” which began to occur with “Social Impact Assessments” being formalized in the US Civil Rights era (Jaquet, 2014). Thus, these holistic socioeconomic assessment tools have a parallel development history to the environmental ones to be discussed, though their economic lineage and toolsets go back much, much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kirwan Institute on Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State developed such a holistic metric, called the Opportunity Index (Reece, 2013). This kind of index goes beyond measuring economic standing and instead was crafted to measure expected life outcomes of residents in three areas: health, education, and economics (Acevedo-Garcia, 2016). It represents the state-of-the-art for holistic measures of “neighborhood vitality” (Reece, 2013). Similar such metrics have been developed in parallel for similar applications by others (Chao, 2013). All of these holistic measures have an ecological mindset about them, conceptualizing the complex socioeconomic network of forces in the city as an ecosystem of assets and liabilities, and Kirwan’s index even includes access to park space as an indicator (Reece, 2013)(Acevedo-Garcia, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools have increasingly been employed to influence development policy at the city and state level (Reece, 2013). Some common shortcomings of such assessments are limitations of available data, arbitration of indicator weights, and a “black box” effect of multidimensional assessments (Chao, 2013)(Oliveira, 2010). Even the most holistic of these metrics does very little to incorporate environmental assessments, which will be discussed next. When they are included, it seems to be due to an intuitive sense of environment and space’s impact on health and wellbeing (Acevedo-Garcia, 2016). The path across Campbell’s Develop Conflict requires more theoretical understanding of measurable mechanics between socioeconomics and environment if they are to be incorporated robustly&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn6:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The socioeconomic side of this mechanic might be hinted by Scott Roger’s “growth machines,” which explores the commodification of place at length (Rogers, 2009).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;environmental-assessment&quot;&gt;Environmental Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental assessment methodologies have a much shorter history, which is tied to the very recent valuation of the natural world by western culture generally&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The first waves of environmental assessment tools were created to map previously unchecked pollution sources &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The recent development of viable environmental assessment is rooted in the simultaneous developments of environmental sensing technology and the agendas of conservation and sustainability (Girardet, 1999). These together have begun to shrink the cost associated with environmental analysis, which is why remote sensing data currently dominates these assessment tools (Brandon, 1997).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental and ecological assessment began investigating urban areas even more recently, as technology and theory developed to meet the extreme complexity problem urban environments pose to researchers (Miller, 2004)(Brandon, 1997). Even so, the same trend toward disaggregation and addition of holistic indicators that can be seen in socioeconomic assessment is already underway in the younger discipline of environmental assessment (Deal, 2001). The term given to radically disaggregated ecological study and assessment is urban metabolism, which attempts to map the city as a network of energy flows and stores (Newman, 1998). A very recent case study by Chrysoulakis et al. (2015) actually combined urban metabolism metrics with rudimentary socioeconomic indicators to create BRIDGE, a digital planning policy tool to predict the energy and social impact of alternative land uses for a given site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools are being rapidly developed for use as advisory assessments for urban planners under the agenda of sustainability (Vásconez, 1999)(Oliveira 2010)(Chrysoulakis, 2015)(Steiner 2016). However, they generally have not been held with much focus within the planning discipline (Oliveira, 2010). This may be due to the discipline’s roots in sociopolitical theory, far from the environmental and ecological sciences (Khakee, 2003). Planning needs to reach out to environmental assessment to incorporate its models of the built environment into its mainly socioeconomic vision of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Environmental Justice
Environmental justice began as a political movement and has developed into a robust research agenda&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We discovered it in the course of literature review, and it underpinned much of the secondary questions of discrimination that we came to pose. Begun in the fusion of social justice and environmentalism activism in the 1970’s United States, Robert Bullard and others brought to light the disproportionate burden of pollution being unloaded onto minority populations &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This focus on environmental risk has turned toward concerns with equity and sustainability by students of Bullard, who have begun to focus on the disproportionate impacts of unsustainability and climate change on impoverished areas globally&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn1:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Agyeman and others have fused the environmental justice agenda with the buzzing zeitgeist of sustainability to form “just sustainabilities,” a vision of equitable environmental and socioeconomic stewardship&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn4:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. By investigating how socioeconomic forces like discrimination reach across to shape environmental policy, these authors have begun to build a bridge across the Development Conflict. This research hopes to link the motivations of their work to the measurement techniques of urban assessment strategies to further build that bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;research-methods&quot;&gt;Research Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scope&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted this research by collecting secondary geospatial data from public sources at the census tract level and investigating correlation and other geospatial relationships between them. This general investigation intended to answer two questions, the first general and the second specific. First, is there a relationship between socioeconomic indicators of vitality and environmental quality indicators? This question was investigated at a county-wide scope and broken down by development age through mapping and correlational analysis. Second, what political or environmental forces shaped the boundaries of these areas? Through the previous analysis we were able to identify neighborhoods that were similar in development age but contrasted along environmental quality. We used these as case studies, investigating the environmental, socioeconomic and public policy histories that might have impacted these “sibling neighborhoods” in their development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;county-univariate-analysis&quot;&gt;County Univariate Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first conducted simple mapping and graphing of single variables to determine the context of the county’s environmental and socioeconomic status (QGIS, 2017). Box plots with scatter plot values were also created for each variable, using the plot.ly web app, to show simple summary statistics over the county (Plotly Technologies, 2015). These univariate analyses were used to support further investigation, and to begin the search for areas of case study interest. Choropleth maps with 7 Jenck’s “natural breaks” value bins were created for each variable, using QGIS, to show similar amounts of variation across the variables, which all use different units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, maps were created using a Cluster Analysis tool developed for QGIS (2017). We used the tool to conduct both Anselin’s Local Moran’s I and Getis-Ord Gi* spatial analyses for all main indicators (Oxoli, 2016). These analyses were used to determine whether the individual variables showed similar clustering behavior over the county’s tracts. This tool was useful for inferring general trends, but could be extended to create more methodical comparisons of maps. This will be outlined further in Limitations below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bivariate--temporal-analyses&quot;&gt;Bivariate &amp;amp; Temporal Analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the univariate mapping and graphing procedures we conducted bivariate mapping and graphing across all the variable pairs. The shapefile data was exported to spreadsheets, through which we applied Pearson’s r column correlation for all pairs. This was our main analysis to establish an initial quantitative relationship between environmental and socioeconomic quality. The strength of these correlations suggested that we investigate further into the temporal relationship of these phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By aggregating Franklin County Auditor tract-level build dates to the a county tract median, we were able to proxy “development ages” for 234 of Franklin County’s 274 tracts (Mingo, 2013). Using these, we broke the set of tracts into 5 age cohorts (using Jenck’s natural breaks). We then conducted the same Pearson’s r column correlation using plot.ly, and mapped these on a multi-line graph (Plotly Technologies, 2015). We believe this shows meaningful changes in outcome between different eras of sociopolitical and environmental housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we created bivariate maps of key variable pairs to visually assess the spatial overlap of low and high areas, as well as identify case study candidates (QGIS, 2017). Our most common method for this procedure was to overlay a choropleth with scaled circles representing the second variable. Another method based on two axis color scaling was created, and proved more effective at communicating nuances in geography (Stevens, 2015). This was in lieu of a more sophisticated bivariate spatial analysis tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study&quot;&gt;Case Study&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final investigation was into a case study area representing two adjacent neighborhoods, Bexley and Near East/South Side. This was meant to be a contrast case study. By identifying one of the stronger boundaries of difference in the county and investigating the area’s background, we hope to bring to light some of the strongest natural, political, and cultural forces that can shape the socioeconomic and environmental quality of a place in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our case study first involved a review of variable values in relation to their means, as well a a general background in demographics and development for both neighborhoods. We then reviewed historical policies of economic and environmental discrimination that might have contributed to the current state of the neighborhoods, as well as natural circumstances of site which may play a more foundational role. While the main aim of this research is to begin a discussion and investigation of the quantifiable relationship between socioeconomic and environmental quality, our case study adds suggestions for changes in future policy to correct environmental inequity and segregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variables--data-sources&quot;&gt;Variables &amp;amp; Data Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are descriptions and supporting explanation for the indicators used during this research. Versions of our dataset can be found at [LINK NEEDED].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;franklin-county-census-tract-shapefile-censusgov-2010&quot;&gt;Franklin County Census Tract Shapefile (Census.gov, 2010)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A census tract shapefile extracted from the Ohio dataset from Census.gov (2014). This served as our template with which to link all other data. After initial investigation available census variable within the shapefile, we edited it down to include only white population % (WP) and housing vacancy % (HV), explained below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;opportunity-index-oi-reece-et-al-2013&quot;&gt;Opportunity Index (OI) (Reece et al., 2013)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created by Reece et al. at the Kirwan Institute for Race &amp;amp; Ethnicity in OSU, this composite metric measures expected life outcomes and neighborhood vitality more robustly than a simple poverty index (2013). It has been calculated at the census tract level. We took it as a simple measure on its own, but there is much more investigation that can be done by investigating the relationship between environmental indicators and the OI’s component variables individually. The OI approximated the balance of socioeconomic assets and liabilities for our research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;mean-canopy-coverage--mcc-homer-et-al-2015&quot;&gt;Mean Canopy Coverage % (MCC) (Homer et al., 2015)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used MCC as a proxy for environmental assets. Trees, while being one of the simplest ecological systems to remotely sense, are one the most impactful aspects on air quality, psychological comfort, and property value within the urban built environment. MCC behaved as an environmental asset in our research.
It is represented in a national raster dataset from USGS National Land Cover Database 2011 showing % of green tree coverage, taken at a 30 meter resolution. After clipping to Franklin county, census tract mean percentages were calculated in ArcMap using the Zonal Statistics tool. We used mean instead of median because it proved to show more nuance in value, especially in rural tracts where coverage can vary drastically with an unstable median.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;mean--impervious-surface-coverage-misc-homer-et-al-2015&quot;&gt;Mean % Impervious Surface Coverage (MISC) (Homer et al., 2015)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MISC was used to proxy environmental stressors. More robust proxies of this exist that measure pollution, air quality, and other stressors as well, but we sought to focus on environmental assets’ relationship with the OI in this exploratory inquiry. MISC behaved as an environmental liability in our research.
It also represented in a national raster dataset from USGS National Land Cover Database 2011 showing % of green tree coverage, taken at a 30 meter resolution. After clipping to Franklin county, census tract mean percentages were calculated in ArcMap using the Zonal Statistics tool. We used mean instead of median because it proved to show more nuance in value, especially in rural tracts where coverage can vary drastically with an unstable median.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;white-population--wp-censusgov-2010&quot;&gt;White Population % (WP) (Census.gov, 2010)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP was used to investigate the environmental dimension of a known high correlation between WP and the OI. Furthermore, the case studies of this research explored historical discriminatory housing policy, along lines of wealth and race, often favored predominantly white neighborhoods over other ethnicities. In our research it behaved as a socioeconomic asset, however we believe that this is due to racial biases in housing and economic policy that the presence of high white population accompanies socioeconomic vitality, not due to any inherent superiority or tenacity of the population itself. This variable was within the Census Bureau shapefile, mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;housing-vacancy--hv-censusgov-2010&quot;&gt;Housing Vacancy % (HV) (Census.gov, 2010)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator was used to explore housing’s relationship to both the OI and environmental variables. It stood in as a measure of neighborhood disinvestment, which we suspected might indicate disinvestment in environmental quality as well.In our research it behaved as a socioeconomic liability. This variable was within the Census Bureau shapefile, mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;median-built-date-mbd-mingo-ii-2013&quot;&gt;Median Built Date (MBD) (Mingo II, 2013)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator was used to divide up Franklin County’s census tracts into development eras. These MBD cohorts were used to both track trends in the correlation between environmental and socioeconomic variables, and to help identify the sibling neighborhoods to be explored further through case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBD was calculated using zonal statistics at the census tract level for the build date variable in the Franklin County Auditor’s housing data, recorded at the plot level. Median build date showed a truer central character of each tract than the mean. It controlled for an old tract being redeveloped much later, which under a mean would return an era in which no development actually occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was highly exploratory in nature, and as such met several sizeable limitations to conclusions and recommendations. First with regards to data, was the resolution and size of the data sets. Census tracts are often misaligned with neighborhood borders, and don’t reflect the functioning semantic divisions of the city that often guide discriminatory policy. Furthermore, these semantic divisions shift continuously throughout history, so place over time might not best track the varying environmental segregation.
Sample size was another issue: there are only 274 census tracts in Franklin County, and each age cohort had only 20-60 tracts within it. Correlation values were used to demonstrate the hint of a powerful and measurable relationship between economic, ethnic, and environmental inequality, and should be taken primarily as motivational evidence for further and more robust lines of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the issue of causation posed an impenetrable web of connections for us. Determining whether a land use policy or existing site conditions contributed more to an area’s poor environmental quality is outside the scope of this research. Our case study investigates a highly contrasting area for this reason; to suggest what might influence the strongest differences in the county. Further research controlling for pre-development site conditions or land value would be beneficial to understand different policy impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-analysis&quot;&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis shows a cursory picture of the landscape of environmental assets and stressors in Columbus, as well as their relationship with socioeconomic variables such as the OI. As stated above, we moved from general univariate analysis of the county to bivariate and temporal analyses, then to a case study exploring historical inequitable policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;county-univariate-analysis-1&quot;&gt;County Univariate Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;environmental-indicators&quot;&gt;Environmental Indicators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin County shows moderate to high levels of MISC compared to MCC on the whole, with a mean of 41.6% coverage, well above MCC’s 15.6% mean (Figure 1). The variation was also much greater with MISC, which had a standard deviation of 15.2%, while MCC’s was 7.9%. In general, Franklin County has much more impervious surface coverage than tree canopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Boxplot of environmental variables over Franklin County&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choropleth maps below show the geographical layout of MCC and MISC, respectively. MCC is lowest at the Columbus urban center, in the large airport census tract east of the core, and out around the southern ring suburbs, which are dotted with industrial and agricultural land uses. The areas of high canopy coverage occur along a green corridor running NNW from the city center, and in the first and second ring suburbs in the NE corner of the county. MISC levels follow a roughly inverted geography, highest in the Columbus downtown and reducing quite smoothly toward the suburban and rural borders of the county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 2: Choropleth map of Franklin County mean impervious surface coverage (MISC)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our application of Getis-Ord Gi* Hotspot Analysis through QGIS revealed likely clusters of high and low values for our indicator variables. MCC was shown in Map 3 to have likely low clustering downtown and toward the agrarian west end of the county, with high value clustering in the NE suburbs and NNW from the first-ring suburbs out, which is likely due to a wealth of park space along the Scioto riverfront. MISC further demonstrated in Map 4 that ring-like gradient from downtown out to the rural suburbs. Both have noticeable non-clustered areas extending out from downtown to the north and east all the way to the county boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 4: Getis-Ord Gi* hot and cold spots of Franklin County mean impervious surface coverage (MISC)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunity-index&quot;&gt;Opportunity Index&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in Methods, the OI is a composite of three component indexes: Education, Job Access &amp;amp; Mobility, and Environmental Hazards (Kirwan, 2013). These component indicators are worth surveying individually for now, as they reveal variation between the different dimensions of opportunity. As seen in Figure 2, the OI itself has a roughly bimodal distribution, with peaks located at +-0.5 of the mean. A similar pattern can be seen in OI-Ed below, with more of a plateau than a peak at &amp;lt;-0.5 z-score. The OI-NB has a skewed-right normal distribution, with a pronounced peak above the mean. OI-HE has the most compact and normal distribution of the three components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Histogram of Opportunity Index and component indexes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The county’s lowest OI scores occur in a swath close on the east side of the I-71 corridor, as well as the near south and southwest neighborhoods outside of Columbus’s downtown. It’s highest can be seen extending NW from downtown out to Dublin at the corner of the count, as well as a NE swath past the first ring suburbs toward Gahanna and New Albany. A notable high outlier is the Bexley, just to the east of downtown, which sits in the middle of the large sector of low-scoring neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 5: Choropleth of Franklin County Opportunity Index (OI) scores&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geits-Ord Gi* Hotspot Analysis of OI, shown in Map 6 below, shows a large outer ring of socioeconomic vitality to the north of the Columbus center, with a complimentarily-shaped area of low OI centered just east of the downtown core. This clear divide of clustering shows the results of the suburban exodus that created the wealthy towns of Dublin, Powell, Gahanna, and most recently New Albany to the north of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 6: Getis-Ord Gi* hot and cold spots of Franklin County Opportunity Index (OI)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-socioeconomic-variables&quot;&gt;Other Socioeconomic Variables&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White population percentage (WP) and vacant housing percentage (VH) are the two other socioeconomic indicators we investigated in our spatial analysis. Columbus generally has a high white population as seen in the box plot below in Figure 3, with a median of 75.28% per tract. However, the variation in per tract percentage is nearly 100%, with a minimum WP of 4.09%. This wide of a variation already suggests a segregated racial landscape before mapping values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing vacancy has a much tighter spread of values, with a variation of 8%, less than a third of WP (26%). It’s median is also low at 7.6%. There are a notable number of high outliers, however, with the maximum being 56.8%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: Boxplot of Franklin County census tract white population (WP) and vacant housing (VH)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping WP reveals clear lines of division in racial makeup. WP follows a generally increasing trend going out toward the rural boundaries of the county, with pockets of high outliers within the urban center, Again, Bexley can be seen here as an outlier of high WP among a swath of low values just to the east of downtown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing vacancy follows a roughly similar though inverted trend of higher frequency downtown and decreasing out toward the rural areas. Interestingly, the high values downtown seem to extend out into the first ring suburbs in a cross formation in the N-S and W-E directions. This may be due to the extensive land taken up by the I-71 and I-70 highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Getis-Ord Gi* Hotspot Analysis of WP shown in Map 8 reveals a varied landscape of high WP areas and a tightly-packed area of low WP. This is indicated by the prevalence of yellow-colored or  uncertain high values, which suggest the the boundaries of these high-WP areas along the outer and western areas of the county are inconclusive. Meanwhile, areas of high minority population have one large swath along the eastern part of Columbus’s first ring suburbs, with much more clearly-defined borders. The gray area at the center of that swath of blue is Bexley, the location of our case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getis-Ord Gi* Hotspot Analysis of VH rates across the county are shown in Map 9. The NW exurban areas show a lightly-clustered area of low values, which high vacancy rates are tightly clustered just to the east of the Columbus downtown core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;county-wide-correlations&quot;&gt;County-wide Correlations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 below shows Pearson’s r calculations for all possible pairings of our five indicator variables. The values represent the relationship between the two indicators’ variations over the county, with stronger relationships being further from 0. A very negative number indicates a strong inverse relationship, such as between the environmental asset canopy coverage (MCC) and the environmental stressor impervious surface coverage (MISC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The striking relationship between WP and OI that serves as a foundation of this research is seen here, were r  = 0.716. The powerful inverse relationships between the other socioeconomic pairings can be seen as well, where OI x HV = -0.649 and HV x WP = -0.59. In fact, all of the asset-liability indicator pairings below show an inverse relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main target pairings for this research are those of MCC and, to a lesser extent, MISC. OI x MCC showed a moderately strong relationship at r = 0.446, and it was the second strongest positively-correlated pairing behind OI x WP. What was surprising for us was the much weaker relationship of white population (WP) to our environmental indicators: MCC x WP = 0.265 and MISC x WP = -0.286. We believe this suggests that race plays a secondary or further-removed role in the demonstrated inequity of access to environmental assets in Columbus, but that there is a substantial relationship between that access disparity and other socioeconomic forces of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4: Pearson’s r correlation of indicator pair values in Franklin County&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;age-cohort-correlations&quot;&gt;Age Cohort Correlations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aggregated tract-level data from the Franklin County Auditor’s public data set to calculate the median build date (MBD) of each census tract. We then grouped these 153 tracts into six age cohorts by their MBD. This data set was collected in 2013, so the cohorts represent a median age in years before that year, which can be seen in the x-axis of Figure 5 below.
The resulting graph shows a compelling, though heavily approximated, possible view of historical trends between the “relationship proximity” between socioeconomic and environmental indicators. Two trends were of enough interest to us to include this graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is a general downward trend in correlation across all variables over the last 110 years. This could either mean that socioeconomic and environmental policy is less and less closely related, or that impacts of the relationship between the two takes a very long time to manifest in the built environment. The second area of interest was in the bubble at -45 years, representing the age cohort from 1963-1973, where all indicator pairs experienced a sharp bump in significance except MCC x MISC. We believe this represents the close tie between economic vitality, racial segregation, and greenery that are the foundations of the suburban era, which occurred during this part of the 20th Century. Map 10 shows the census tracts composing this cohort highlighted on the MCC choropleth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bivariate-mapping&quot;&gt;Bivariate Mapping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bivariate mapping proved to be a confounding problem in our research. The issue can be broken into two facets: first, quantitative measures are scarce and difficult to glean meaningful relationships from, and second, it is difficult to create clear visual coding of bivariate spatial trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the first issue can be seen in Maps 11 and 12 below, where we applied the only available bivariate cluster analysis tool we could find to OI x MCC, called Bivariate Local Moran’s I. This type of cluster analysis shows the relationship between an “ego variable” and a “neighbor variable,” where a High-Low Outlier reflects a high ego variable value surrounded by low neighbor variable values (BioMedware, 2014). This means that there is a directionality of relationship between the two variables, which can be seen in Map 12, where MCC is now the ego variable and OI the neighbor variable. This makes interpreting such results even more complicated, and has made it clear to us that new bivariate spatial analysis methods must be developed for future interdisciplinary spatial assessment research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 11: Bivariate local Moran’s I for OI → MCC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 12: Bivariate local Moran’s I for MCC → OI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second issue can be seen in Maps 13 and 14 below. Visual coding of scales is very difficult in bivariate maps. Two contemporary methods are shape overlays (Map 13) and bivariate choropleth maps (Map 14). We present these for reader review, as well as other variable pairings in our Appendix, however we have reservations that these methods of visual communication are too complex and too easily manipulated to be trusted for in-depth reading. With maps as varied and perceptual as these, we run into a Rorschach Test problem of reading our biases toward perceived clustering into these maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-near-east--bexley&quot;&gt;Case Study: Near East &amp;amp; Bexley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our case study explores the first ring suburbs of Bexley and Near East/Southside, seen below in Map 15. There are several areas of interest across the county, but we selected these two for closer investigation because of the stark boundary of difference between them in most of our indicators, as well as their intertwined historical relationship, with starkly different policy treatments. These two neighborhoods thus represent one of the most extreme examples of the relationship between environment and socioeconomics in the county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will first describe the existing conditions of the area by mapping the results of our research areas, then describing the experiential contrast of the two spaces that prompted the investigation. Then we will investigate those historical policy differences more closely. Positive feedback loops of environmental degradation have been created by 20th Century discriminatory policy to intertwine minority-dominated populations like Near East with unstable environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 15: Tracts comprising Bexley &amp;amp; Southside study areas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conditions-comparison&quot;&gt;Conditions Comparison&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen below in Map 16, we found that Bexley and Near East/Southside contrasted greatly in socioeconomic vitality as measured by the OI. Bexley scored well above the median, while Southside was an especially distressed area, even within the relatively stagnant swath of the east streetcar suburbs of Columbus. Bexley was a notable high outlier in our cluster analyses (Appendix Map X).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 16: OI of Bexley &amp;amp; Southside study areas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in Map 17, Bexley had one of the highest-scoring tracts for MCC in the area surrounding downtown Columbus. It dipped down to about the county median in the southern area. Near East/Southside was moderately low on the whole in MCC, with a sharp decline on its western edge nearest downtown. While this disparity in MCC could be somewhat explained by the difference in proximity to the urban core, it is also related to different land use types, with more industrial properties located in the Near East area, especially around the highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 17: MCC of Bexley &amp;amp; Southside study areas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Map 18 shows the MISC of both areas. Here they are largely similar, save for the NW tract of the Bexley area, which has a sizeable park space that limits its MISC. On the whole both have moderate and moderate-high coverage rates, which is likely mostly due to their urban development pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 18: MISC of Bexley &amp;amp; Southside study areas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Map 19 below show the ethnic disparity that made Bexley such a strong contrast for case study. The Bexley census tracts have WP values of around 90%, whereas much of the Near East/Southside tracts have WP well below 20%. The two tracts at the boundary of the two areas have 6 and 8% WP. This suggests a racial boundary that was constructed out of more than implicit forces, and our historical analysis will show the powerful explicit policies that constructed this boundary of difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 19: WP of Bexley &amp;amp; Southside study areas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Map 20 below shows VH values for the case study area. Urban VH rates are rather high across the board in urban areas, but Bexley is doing well at avoiding major blight, and its NE tract has rates of under 5%. Near East/Southside is not fairing as well, with moderate to moderately high VH on the whole, and the hardest-hit areas occurring along the I-70 corridor to the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Map 20: VH of Bexley &amp;amp; Southside study areas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiential difference felt when crossing the boundary between Bexley and Near East is what initially motivated this research, which can be seen in Figure 6 below. Bexley is famed as the first city to be declared an arboretum, and has put several decades of effort and budget to cultivate a atmosphere of environmental health that can be felt immediately (Rosenstein, 2017). Near East is not out of the ordinary in its dearth of canopy, it is similar to most of its urban counterparts, but the contrast is made stark by the success and greenery of Bexley. That will be a common theme of this case study; it is not so much Near East and Southside’s struggles that are unusual, but Bexley’s consistent avoidance of socioeconomic and environmental burdens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6: Views down secondary streets off of Main St., Bexley above and Near East below (Google Maps, 2016).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-comparison&quot;&gt;Historical Comparison&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our working model of the contrast between these neighborhoods is that socioeconomic instability gives rise to environmental instability. High-value urban ecologically is a form of gardening, which requires effort and time to maintain, which requires relative stability of the people, these gardeners. Socioeconomic instability means less homeowners and more renters and landlords, who generally have little incentive for environmental improvements. Thus a policy which destabilizes the economy of a neighborhood while securing another could, over a long time, result in the kind of contrast we see between Near East and Bexley’s tree canopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the history we will be exploring with the three policy contrasts covered below. At the sunset of American explicit segragationist policy in the 20th Century, several policies were employed which ensured the persistence of an implicit segregation. They included home mortgage “redlining,” restrictive covenants, and others which devalued the people and the land of neighborhoods like Near East. This devaluation allowed for the later decision of what areas to demolish to build the I-70 corridor to align neatly with minority-dominated neighborhoods, the cheapest land to redevelop. We hope to illuminate this positive feedback loop of socioeconomic discrimination devaluing certain people and thereby destabilizing the places which they occupy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;redlining&quot;&gt;Redlining&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redlining is a term given to the discriminatory mortgage lending practices of the Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) as a part of the New Deal in the 1930’s (Engaging Columbus, 2016). This relief fund guided mortgage lending rates in 239 cities across the US by grading areas along ethnic and socioeconomic indicators. Thus, areas high in minority population and/or low-income residents were deemed highest risk for mortgage default, while the the new affluent suburbs were rated “most desirable.” This created a biased flow of investment funding toward more white, suburban, and affluent areas across Columbus and many other cities, and the effects on the developmental success of these areas can be felt today. Figure 7 below shows the original HOLC redlining map for Columbus side-by-side with our OI map for the county. The pattern of similarity between the two can be seen in the general outward trend in wealth toward the suburbs, especially to the NW of the city. Bexley is marked as “most desirable” on this HOLC map, while a rising black neighborhood called the Village of Hanford that used to neighbor it where Near East is today is graded “highest risk.” The story of Hanford Villages destruction will be discussed below.
This policy linked people’s inherent value, here in terms of perceived “risk,” to the place they live, and embedding that devaluation into the place. Thus, it is a policy which assessed people’s ethnicity as an environmental liability. It is a trend we will see continued below with restrictive covenants, where fear of the perceived socioeconomic destabilizing effects of ethnic minority presence encites policymakers and homeowners alike to segregate from them and continually isolate them into neighborhoods like Near East and Linden. Because these minorities carry that perceived risk with them, the spaces they are restricted to are thereby instantly devalued by the market, further destabilizing the area and creating a self-fulfilling positive feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 7: HOLC map to left, OI choropleth to right. Note the overall similarity, and area of “most desirable” green east of downtown, labelled Bexley.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restrictive-covenants&quot;&gt;Restrictive Covenants&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restrictive covenants were a housing practice that saw popularity in the early- to mid-20th Century, in which a homeowner could stipulate the identity of any future owner of their home in their land deed (Dornberg House, 2011). In many parts of Columbus and America broadly, landowners restricted both future ownership and occupancy to explicitly exclude “colored persons” except in the capacity of servants on their land. Point 6 of covenant from the Woodley Park neighborhood of Columbus illustrates the reasoning used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All of the Owners for themselves, their heirs, executors administrators and assigns, agree that the ownership, occupancy or use by any colored person of any of the property above mentioned (except as a servant as above provided) constitutes and will constitute irreparable injury to the property above mentioned and to the owners of said property at the time of such sale…(Dornberg House, 2011)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular covenant lasted from 1924 to 1949, essentially a 25 moratorium on black access to a wealthy stretch of street in Columbus. Here the implicit devaluation of property by ethnicity is made very explicit. It is clear that homeowners were (and still are) worried about proximity to minority ethnicities devaluing their property. The restrictive covenants are the step in this loop which access to higher-value areas, quarantining them to low-value areas with no system of reinvestment. It is this kind of stagnation, set up by these policies and others, that cultivates neighborhoods of persistenly low socioeconomic and environmental quality. As we’ll see with I-70, when it then comes time to sacrifice an area for the redevelopment of city assets, this inequality is made final with the destruction of one neighborhood over another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-70--hanford-village&quot;&gt;I-70 &amp;amp; Hanford Village&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the I-70 corridor was the final step in the the self-reinforcing loop of environmental disinvestment from Near East. The first act destabilized the mortgage market for black neighborhoods like Near East across Columbus, then the second restricted their access to wealthier areas through deed covenants. They set the stage for black spaces to be devalued in the eyes of Columbus’s government, and led to the destruction of its first neighborhood marketed to middle class black families (Parsons, 1998). Hanford Village was a small 1.75 acre area just east of Southside and Near East, across Alum Creek from South Bexley (Howard, 2012). When in the 1960’s the two trends of urban renewal and highway infrastructure aligned, I-70 cut through Columbus’s downtown destroying several urban neighborhoods for its straight corridor path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things equal, it would have continued east and cut through South Bexley, but planners made deals with Bexley residents and organization to spare the neighborhood. Instead, I-70 took its infamous “Alum Creek curve” and instead cut through the Hanford Village Park, bisecting the 15 year-old neighborhood and stunting its development severely (Parsons, 1998). The area was made virtually inaccessible and its main public green space was destroyed, and though today it enjoys protection as a Historic Place, it sees little growth or settlement (Farenchik, 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see that discriminatory socioeconomic policy can cause extreme environmental inequality through disinvestment. This cycle of destabilization, isolation, and disinvestment is, in our proposed model, a self-fulfilling manifestation of discrimination. The story of Near East crippling shows how the effects of racism can be charted through economics and make lasting impacts on the environments of the city. We as planners must fuse the competing interests of the environment and its people if we are to see how socioeconomic forces like racism impact both in similar inequitable ways. Only then can we understand those socioeconomic forces operate, and work to remedy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research set out to answer an exploratory question, “Is there a relationship between the geography of environmental indicators and socioeconomic ones in Columbus, OH?” W e have shown several forms of analysis which suggest that there is, including simple regression analysis and spatial cluster analyses. In the following discussion we will posit several hypotheses we believe shape the nuances of this geography we have mapped with this research. We will then discuss the possible role that discrimination may play in environmental geography. Finally, we will discuss several major limitations of our type of inquiry and call for further, more robust forms of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hypotheses-of-geographical-nuance&quot;&gt;Hypotheses of Geographical Nuance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have shown that there is a moderate correlation between environmental and socioeconomic indicators for Franklin County, the relationship is not universal. It appears that complex socioeconomic forces, including discrimination and racism, influence the dispersion of environmental assets and stressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, environmental and socioeconomic indicators interact with those forces in different ways, based on everything from cultural value of the environment to the biome the city rests in. This makes teasing out generalizable knowledge, or even conducting a similar study in a nearby region, a difficult and risky task. A underlying social role of premium environmental assets like canopy coverage in Columbus must be explored before a similar study could be done in diverse locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time seems to be another deeply interwoven factor to explore further. While we did a cursory exploration using build date and indicator correlations, there are several aspects of the relationship between socioeconomics and environment that appear time-sensitive. We are interested in how settlement patterns affect and are affected by socioeconomic forces, and whether environmental assets shift more dramatically over long development periods. It seems intuitive that environmental development and degradation might occur much slower, or on a lag from socioeconomic interventions, but research on the specific environmental impacts of a policy would need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-discrimination&quot;&gt;The Role of Discrimination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis that urban environmental assets may serve as an indicator for socioeconomic stability is extended by the role that discrimination plays in urban redevelopment interventions. Herbert Gans documented the misguided reasoning that leads public officials and developers to raze and rebuild low-income neighborhoods for revitalization, and his archetypal timeline seems to have played out in several areas of Columbus over the years (Gans, 1962). Our case study of Bexley and Near East/Southside demonstrates how important a role racial discrimination can play in a neighborhood’s relative scarcity of environmental assets. Beyond the role of instability-inducing “revitalization” methods, there is extensive evidence of public land policy that was designed with ethnic and socioeconomic discrimination in mind. This research hopes to demonstrate how those socioeconomically discriminatory practices can echo repercussions into even the ecology of the city, and persist for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 8 below outlines the hypothetical positive feedback loop developed through our case study research. This provides a plausible outline of environmental disinvestment, which begins and ends with discrimination. This discrimination is a devaluation of a certain kind of people, and that devaluation leads to a socioeconomic policy intervention which destabilizes that groups standing in a city or place. In our case study example, this intervention was the HOLC redlining maps, which destabilized the homeownership of non-white citizens across Columbus and other cities. Destabilization initiates a process of real natural devaluation of areas occupied by those targeted populations, in our case areas with black families, essentially turning minority people into an economic liability. Homeowners, worried about being affected by proximity to these people, create policy tools restricting them from infiltrating their prosperous neighborhoods, which can be as explicit as our example of restrictive covenants or much subtler. Now isolated and drained of both value and stability, these neighborhoods enter a stagnation of development and the conditions for environmental disinvestment are met. The preconceived discrimination is reinforced by this self-fulfilling result of devaluation, and the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 8: Hypothetical model of self-fulfilling discriminatory disinvestment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is surprising and disquieting that public policy can have such lasting unintentional impacts on environmental inequity. The comfort comes in the reverse realization, that if public policy can by this process have this lasting an impact on urban ecology, it can reverse and even cultivate meaningful value in it with proper guidance. By further exploring the force implicit bias can have on the development patterns of the city and its ecology, we can combat its destabilizing and inequitable power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-and-roles-of-environmental-indicator-analysis&quot;&gt;Challenges and Roles of Environmental Indicator Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We engaged with this research because the technology of remote sensing had advanced to make it reasonable to map out the differences in tree cover and paved surfaces that we experienced throughout the city. During the literature review process we found that the joining of socioeconomic and ecological metrics is a budding subfield along that cutting edge of remote sensing, and we felt some of the limitations of such new methods and tools in the course of our investigation. We will outline some pitfalls we perceive in the field of remote sensing evaluation, and suggest a proper place for it to fit into a framework of research and policy development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward and looming limitation of remote sensing evaluation lies in its remoteness. The term “remote sensing” refers to physical distance, but it is also theoretically remote from the phenomena being measured. We experienced this in every dimension of our data. Our MCC and MISC data were aggregated from 30m-resolution raster data, summations of pixelated photos, and our socioeconomic data was aggregated at the census tract level. This issue of resolution will diminish through innovation and new datasets, but will likely be 2 or 3 steps of aggregation and approximation away from actually mapping these kinds of indicators throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next level of “remoteness” comes when we question the significance of the chosen indicators. Any environmental indicator will have an application limited to the “appropriate” area to measure it, which is heavily influenced by everything from socially-constructed value to biome. The selection of tree coverage as an indicator of environmental investment was an intuitive and, we believe, appropriate choice for Columbus, OH, but it would be ridiculous to use in Phoenix, Arizona. Even within Franklin County we found that it was not always a great proxy of environmental quality, especially further south and west of the city where farmland dominates, and though the environment is high-quality, it could not be captured by our metrics. This question of environmental quality is much more tangled with socially constructed value than we had anticipated, and that could limit the translation of studies like ours, especially to areas of distinct ecology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these limitations, we propose that remote sensing evaluation be used mainly as a scouting tool for the foreseeable future. It is a remarkably fast way to get a cursory sense of the landscape of an issue and map out areas of interest and points of conflict. However, it is not yet a reliable enough method on which to base policies. We have situated the process of inquiry we developed as a kind of spatial literature review: it has given us a broad sense of the landscape of Franklin County, and has given us a handful of meaningful areas of interest and gaps in knowledge to fill. We believe that on-the-ground surveys and case studies are where the impactful insights can then be definitively mapped. Because these kinds of inquiry are much more expensive and time-intensive, we believe that remote sensing metrics can prioritize study areas for research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research demonstrates a visible and measurable relationship between socioeconomic vitality and environmental assets in Franklin County, OH. Through further historical analysis it then explored the role discrimination may play in the variations seen in environmental investment across the county. It began to establish a theoretical framework, a possible way through the Development Conflict as outlined by Scott Campbell&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn6:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, by understanding the environmental effects of discrimination. By understanding the mechanics by which discrimination influence the distribution of both wealth and environmental assets, we can begin to tease out a deep relationship between culture and land. This exploratory research established that such a measurable relationship is plausible based on correlational and spatial analyses. It hopes to encourage further investigation, which might find that bridge across the Development Conflict, and build a vision of sustainability that is both socially and environmentally equitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the simple steps that many other have documented on how to build a box drum, including how to make it with an adjustable snare. The one addition I made is to design the gear handle for the snare adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was a rewarding combination of only a few simple steps. It was a big confidence boost for me as a DIYer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandma loves genealogy. I remember stopping at cemeteries on road trips as a kid, trying to piece together the long story of our history from charcoal rubbings of old worn headstones. The old family joke was that she’d rather go there instead of the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this kind of graph could spook some people with its blunt treatment of life’s finite length. But I take it with some family pride that my wonderful grandfather, upon seeing my little chart with his dot furthest along, said to me with his winking clarity, &lt;em&gt;“so I suppose the goal is to reach the middle then?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frank RJ Noirot</name></author><summary type="html">I built a calendar tool using D3.js to help remember upcoming birthdays in my big family.</summary></entry></feed>
