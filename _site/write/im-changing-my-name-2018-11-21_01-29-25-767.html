<p>On December 1st, 2018 I will be starting the process of changing my legal name from <em>Frank Richard Johnson</em> to <em>Francis Richard Johnson Noirot</em>. I have been using my mother’s maiden name in various pseudonymous ways, but I’m finally making it official. I consider it my first major act of designing myself and my life. Here are the few reasons that I’m making the jump:</p>
<h2 id="1-having-a-formalized-version-of-a-first-name-is-the-best">1. Having a formalized version of a first name is the best</h2>
<p>I’m staking a lifelong position here: every person ought to have a name with both formal and casual versions. Quote me on it. My frustration with an official name like Frank has mounted with every missed understanding, every time my name magically became a bark or “Brent” in the space between my mouth and my audience’s ears. I’m sure all my fellow 1-syllable-namers can concur: the 2-syllable name is a godsend for introductions.</p>
<h2 id="2-nor--ō">2. /<em>nor · ‘ō</em>/</h2>
<p>My maternal family name is just so cool to say in the French manner. Truthfully, my entire family pronouces it  in the Americanized /’nor · ot/). But my uncle Kevin and I like to have more fun with it.</p>
<h2 id="3-choosing-my-family-history">3. Choosing my family history</h2>
<p><em>Francis Richard Johnson → Lawrence Richard Johnson → Lawrence Richard Johnson Jr → Frank Richard Johnson</em>
This is the line of my name, starting with my paternal great-grandfather and coming down to me. Each of the men in this list saw or felt their father’s abuse, was broken by it, and then abused their own family in time. My dad told me once, when I was 19, that he thinks we have a family curse.</p>

<p>But I don’t think that’s how history works.</p>

<p>I’m changing my name to point toward the man I want to be. That is a man after my mother, Melodi Ann Noirot (later Pilz), who raised three kids while trying to raise a husband, who taught her troubled son macreme and how to breathe. After my grandmother, Lois Darlene Meekins (later Noirot), who is the very essence of the word “dignified”. They are the story I want to be a part of.</p>

<p>I also get to have the same <a href="https://www.instagram.com/franknoirot">instagram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/franknoirot">github</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/franknoirot">twitter</a> handles, so that’s pretty nice too.</p>
