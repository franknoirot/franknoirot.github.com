Over the fall of 2017 I printed all of the parts needed to build Ryan Zellers' excellent CNC machine design, the Mostly Printed CNC.

CNC's use code to move their center around in three dimensions within a frame. The tool holder at its center can hold anything from a pen to a router or even a laser. It was the perfect thing for me to build while I continue to learn both fabrication and coding- a tool exactly at the center of those two spaces!

While this essentially a kit build, I include it in my portfolio because it was such a long process of learning and building. The plastic parts on this machine were 3d printed in over 30 hours of prints that I troubleshooted and assembled. Furthermore, I built the 3D printer that made all those parts, so it has been a nesting doll of fabrication.

Finally getting to see this thing move was amazing. I was so excited to see that it worked that I built another one and donated it to [The Maker Club at OSU](http://osumakerclub.org/).
