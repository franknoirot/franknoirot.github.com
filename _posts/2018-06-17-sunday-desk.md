I named this desk the Sunday because that was the day I woke up and designed and built it in one go.

This was the weirdest projects I think I've ever worked on because it was so effortless. It was so much fun, and so surreal, to have a fully formed plan in my head about how to make something then just get to making it. I only drew one sketch before cutting wood.

I don't know if I learned any lessons or best practices from this project other than sometimes you should just let it rip and have fun with making things.
