On December 1st, 2018 I will be starting the process of changing my legal name from _Frank Richard Johnson_ to _Francis Richard Johnson Noirot_. I have been using my mother's maiden name in various pseudonymous ways, but I'm finally making it official. I consider it my first major act of designing myself and my life. Here are the few reasons that I'm making the jump:
## 1. Having a formalized version of a first name is the best
I'm staking a lifelong position here: every person ought to have a name with both formal and casual versions. Quote me on it. My frustration with an official name like Frank has mounted with every missed understanding, every time my name magically became a bark or "Brent" in the space between my mouth and my audience's ears. I'm sure all my fellow 1-syllable-namers can concur: the 2-syllable name is a godsend for introductions.
## 2. /_nor &middot; '&#333;_/
My maternal family name is just so cool to say in the French manner. Truthfully, my entire family pronouces it  in the Americanized /'nor &middot; ot/). But my uncle Kevin and I like to have more fun with it.
## 3. Family history
This moment, 5 years ago, set me on this path to name change. I have two rebuttals to my worried father. First, his view of history forgets the miraculous strength and wisdom that are the real legacies of the Johnson and Noirot family tree: Dessie Johnson, Lois Noirot, Melodi Pilz, Dani Johnson (I'll link to the essay I want to write about this in the future). Second, with it he condemns himself to an Ethan Frome story; locked into a path destined by his circumstances. 

With this name change, I will make formal my rejection of that cycle of family tragedy. I will reject that birthright and that story, and turn toward the mother and grandmother who made me the man I am today. And I move on hoping to make them proud carrying their story forward.

I also get to have the same [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/franknoirot), [github](https://github.com/franknoirot), and [twitter](https://twitter.com/franknoirot) handles, so that's pretty nice too.
