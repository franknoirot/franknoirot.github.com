I built a custom barcart for my good friend Kaz for his birthday.

Making this piece of furniture felt like a natural extension of my work on the [steel chair](/make/steel-plywood-chair). In essence it is very similar, but in details it was much more difficult. The same rectangular frame of steel was just made more difficult with many more joints and smaller square tubing than before. The same simple plywood was used, but this time I had to learn how to make a box instead of cut simple panels. I highly recommend this as a second, more ambitious furniture piece for people just learning.

The principles I learned from the steel chair apply here, but to them I'll add a few:
  - **Use your scraps.** The wood triangle accents are simply cutoffs from the box of the barcart. You get visual harmony for free by reusing cutoffs from your project, because they repeat the same angles/dimensions throughout.
  - **Field measurements > model measurements.** There is always going to be a difference between the theory and the reality when making things, especially at a beginner level. Learn to take good field measurements so you can go with that flow.
  - **_Sometimes_ make things disassemble.** I made this come apart into three pieces, in case any one of them break or wear down in the future (like refinishing rusted steel in a few years). This is a good thing to consider when building things using multiple materials.

I haven't mocked up the 3D model of this yet, but I will embed it here for you to download soon.

If you're interested in commissioning some furniture from me, [shoot me an email]({{ site.email }}). I'm still a pretty poor welder, but I'm willing to do cheap projects in exchange for the chance to practice!
