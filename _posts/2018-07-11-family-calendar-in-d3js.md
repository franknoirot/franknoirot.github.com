I built a calendar tool using Blockbuilder and D3.js to help remember upcoming birthdays in my big family.

Hover over each of the dots to meet my family! The sweep of color around the circle represents how far we are in this year, and the Age axis goes from 0 on the outer edge to 100 on the inner edge.

My grandma loves genealogy. I remember stopping at cemeteries on road trips as a kid, trying to piece together the long story of our history from charcoal rubbings of old worn headstones. The old family joke was that she'd rather go there instead of the beach.

Admittedly, this kind of graph could spook some people with its blunt treatment of life's finite length. But I take it with some family pride that my wonderful grandfather, upon seeing my little chart with his dot furthest along, said to me with his winking clarity, _"so I suppose the goal is to reach the middle then?"_
