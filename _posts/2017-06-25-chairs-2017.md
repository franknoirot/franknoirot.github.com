I made two chairs during the summer after graduating from college.

The first is a __steel & plywood chair__ I made to learn welding from my stepfather after finding out he owned a mig welder. I 3D modeled it after making it for practice, and the model can be seen at the end of the page.

The second is a replica of a __director's chair__ I had borrowed from a roommate and had to give back soon. I took it as a good chance to learn some woodworking and sewing.

Some key things I learned while making these were:
- Welding is a whole lot more forgiving than woodworking, because it contains both _additive &amp; subtractive_ manipulation.
- Starting square is the most important thing about furniture. If you're off at the start, your errors will compound endlessly.
- Documenting your exact end product is beneficial for really obvious reasons: so you're not making design decisions with an electrical torch in your hands and a visor on your head that makes you blind. Not that that happened to me or anything.

I did a field-measured 3D CAD model in Autodesk Fusion after I was done building it, and I've published it on Sketchfab.com if you'd like to download the model for your own use. Here's an embedded view:
