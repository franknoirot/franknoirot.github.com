This simple chair was my first attempt at welding. I built it using my stepfather's welder and some teaching from my friend Devin.

Some key things I learned on this project were:
- Welding is a whole lot more forgiving than woodworking, because it contains both _additive &amp; subtractive_ manipulation.
- Starting square is the most important thing about furniture. If you're off at the start, your errors will compound endlessly.
- Documenting your exact end product is beneficial for really obvious reasons: so you're not making design decisions with an electrical torch in your hands and a visor on your head that makes you blind.

I did a field-measured 3D CAD model in Autodesk Fusion after I was done building it, and I've published it on Sketchfab.com if you'd like to download the model for your own use. Here's an embedded view:
